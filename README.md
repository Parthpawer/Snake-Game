# 🐍 Snake Game with Turtle Graphics 🎮

Welcome to the Snake Game, a classic arcade experience built with Python and the vibrant Turtle graphics library! 🚀

## Overview

This simple yet addictive game involves controlling a snake 🐍 on the screen, collecting red food 🍎 to grow longer, all while avoiding collisions with the screen edges and the snake's own tail.

## 📂 Files

### 1. `main.py`
