# Snake Game with Turtle Graphics

This is a simple Snake Game built using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game consists of a snake controlled by the arrow keys, with the goal of collecting red food items to grow longer. The snake must avoid colliding with the screen edges and itself.

## Files

### 1. `main.py`

The main entry point for the Snake Game. It initializes the game window, the snake, food, and the scoreboard. Arrow keys control the snake's direction. The game loops until the snake collides with the screen edges or itself.

### 2. `snake.py`

Defines the `Snake` class, responsible for the snake's behavior and movement. The snake grows longer when it consumes food, and the game ends if it collides with the screen edges or itself.

### 3. `food.py`

Implements the `Food` class, representing the red food items that the snake must eat to grow. The food appears randomly on the screen.

### 4. `score.py`

Contains the `Scoreboard` class, handling the game score. It displays the current score on the screen and updates it whenever the snake consumes food.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Run `main.py` to start the Snake Game.
3. Control the snake's direction using the arrow keys.
4. Collect red food items to increase your score.
5. The game ends if the snake collides with the screen edges or itself.
